        <h1>📘 Power-Sharing – Comprehensive Notes (Belgium & Sri Lanka)</h1>

        <hr>

        <h2>🧭 Part 1: Case Studies – Belgium and Sri Lanka</h2>

        <h3>🇧🇪 Case Study: Belgium</h3>

        <h4>Geographical and Demographic Background:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Belgium is a small country in Europe, smaller in area than Haryana.</li>
            <li>It shares borders with France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Luxembourg.</li>
            <li>It has a population of a little over one crore, about half that of Haryana.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ethnic Composition:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>59% live in the Flemish region and speak Dutch.</li>
            <li>40% live in the Wallonia region and speak French.</li>
            <li>1% speak German.</li>
            <li>In Brussels, the capital:
                <ul>
                    <li>80% speak French.</li>
                    <li>20% speak Dutch.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Nature of the Problem:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The French-speaking minority was relatively rich and powerful.</li>
            <li>The Dutch-speaking majority resented their delayed access to economic development and education.</li>
            <li>Tensions escalated in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Brussels where:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dutch-speaking were the national majority.</li>
                    <li>But French-speaking were the capital’s majority.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Belgium’s Solution (1970–1993):</h4>
        <p>Belgian leaders amended the Constitution four times to resolve the conflict through innovative power-sharing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Equal representation in central government:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dutch and French-speaking ministers must be equal in number.</li>
                    <li>Special laws need majority approval from both linguistic groups.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous regional governments:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many central government powers were transferred to state (regional) governments.</li>
                    <li>These are not subordinate to the central government.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Separate government for Brussels:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brussels has its own government with equal representation for both linguistic communities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Community government:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elected by people of the same language group (Dutch, French, or German), regardless of region.</li>
                    <li>Handles cultural, educational, and language-related issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Outcome:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Though complex, the arrangement has been effective.</li>
            <li>It helped avoid civic strife and the division of Belgium.</li>
            <li>Brussels was chosen as the headquarters of the European Union, indicating international recognition of its political stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h3>�🇰 Case Study: Sri Lanka</h3>

        <h4>Geographical and Demographic Background:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sri Lanka is an island nation located near Tamil Nadu, India.</li>
            <li>It has a population of around two crore, similar to Haryana.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ethnic Composition:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sinhala-speakers: 74% (mostly Buddhists).</li>
            <li>Tamil-speakers: 18% (13% Sri Lankan Tamils, rest Indian Tamils).</li>
            <li>Christians: 7% (from both Sinhala and Tamil groups).</li>
            <li>Sri Lankan Tamils are concentrated in the north and east.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Nature of the Problem:</h4>
        <p>After independence in 1948, Sri Lankan leaders from the Sinhala majority imposed majoritarian policies.</p>

        <h4>Majoritarian Measures:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>1956 Sinhala Only Act:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sinhala declared the only official language.</li>
                    <li>Tamil was disregarded.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preferential policies for Sinhalas:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Favoured in government jobs and education.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>State-sponsored Buddhism:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Constitution committed to protecting and fostering Buddhism, marginalizing other faiths.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Reaction of Sri Lankan Tamils:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Felt alienated and discriminated against.</li>
            <li>Their cultural identity, language, and political rights were ignored.</li>
            <li>Demanded recognition of Tamil as an official language, equality in jobs and education, and regional autonomy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Civil War:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Peaceful demands were repeatedly denied.</li>
            <li>By the 1980s, militant groups emerged demanding an independent Tamil state (Tamil Eelam).</li>
            <li>A full-blown civil war broke out.
                <ul>
                    <li>Thousands were killed.</li>
                    <li>Families were displaced or fled as refugees.</li>
                    <li>The economy and social fabric were devastated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The war officially ended in 2009.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Outcome:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Majoritarianism severely damaged national unity.</li>
            <li>The refusal to share power created a violent and lasting conflict.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>🧭 Part 2: Why Power Sharing is Desirable & Forms of Power Sharing</h2>

        <h3>💡 Why Power Sharing is Desirable</h3>
        <p>Power sharing is supported by two main kinds of reasons: <strong>prudential</strong> and <strong>moral</strong>.</p>

        <h3>1️⃣ Prudential Reasons (Practical Justifications):</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Power sharing is good because it helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevents civil unrest and violent conflict.</li>
            <li>Ensures political stability and economic growth.</li>
            <li>Helps avoid the tyranny of the majority.</li>
            <li>A means to accommodate social diversity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🔍 <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            Belgium used balanced arrangements to avoid internal division and promote peaceful coexistence.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Tyranny of the majority is not just oppressive for the minority; it often affects the majority adversely as well.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>2️⃣ Moral Reasons (Democratic Principles):</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>In a democracy, people must be consulted on how they are governed.</li>
            <li>Government must be legitimate and inclusive.</li>
            <li>Ensures public participation and respect for all communities.</li>
            <li>Builds trust and a sense of ownership among citizens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>📌 Summary of Reasons:</h4>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Type</th>

        <h2>🧱 Forms of Power Sharing</h2>
        <p>Power can be shared in four major ways:</p>

        <h3>🔹 1. Among Different Organs of Government <em>(Horizontal Power Sharing)</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Power is shared among the <strong>legislature, executive, and judiciary</strong>.</li>
            <li>Each organ operates at the <strong>same level</strong> but has <strong>separate functions</strong>.</li>
            <li>Prevents concentration of power.</li>
            <li>Based on <strong>checks and balances</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🔍 <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            India’s judiciary can strike down laws that violate the Constitution, checking the legislature’s power.</p>

        <h3>🔹 2. Among Governments at Different Levels <em>(Vertical Power Sharing)</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Power is divided among <strong>central, state, and local governments</strong>.</li>
            <li>Known as <strong>federalism</strong>.</li>
            <li>Each level has constitutionally assigned powers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🔍 <strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>India: Union and State Governments + Panchayats.</li>
            <li>Belgium: Separate powers for regional and central governments.</li>
